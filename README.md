# Odins-Eye-Recipes
This is a web app for saving and sharing recipes. The demo is meant to showcase my understanding my understanding of software development fundamentals, React/TypeScript, user authentication, and database interaction.

### Version 0.0.1
Versions consist of three numbers. Remember that the numbers, separated by periods, are not decimals! For instance, "0.0.11" is a higher version than "0.0.2".
The first of these numbers represents the major version. This will only change for very large, important updates/patches.
The second number represents minor changes that do not drastically change how the app works.
The third number represents trivial changes, such as fixing typos.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
